The model is designed to generate high-quality textbook-like data, improving upon issues like hallucinations and bias found in models trained on web data. Phi-1.5 is open-source and outperforms many large models, particularly in multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematics and coding. The report includes benchmark comparisons with other models and datasets, indicating phi-1.5's strengths and noting that performance can be influenced by the model's memorized knowledge. The report's findings are based on the authors' evaluations and were published by Microsoft Research on September 11, 2023.

 Page 2: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, which include models with hundreds of billions of parameters, have significantly improved natural language processing capabilities. However, the large scale of these models raises economic, scientific, and ethical concerns due to their cost, energy consumption, and governance challenges. Research is now focusing on whether smaller models can achieve similar advanced capabilities to make AI more accessible and manageable. A new model called phi-1.5, with 1.3 billion parameters, demonstrates common sense reasoning on par with much larger models, despite being trained on a smaller dataset consisting of 30 billion tokens, including synthetically generated data to reduce toxicity and bias. Phi-1.5 has been made open-source to encourage research on AI reasoning and to address issues such as in-context learning and reducing errors. The model is more efficient for experimentation, requiring less computational resources for training and inference.

 Page 3: Table 1 of the report details the efficiency of various AI models on an Nvidia A100-80G GPU using 2048 length context and fp16 precision. The Llama-7B model expends 80,000 GPU hours for processing, achieves a speed of 14ms per token, consumes 18G memory, and supports datasets up to 1 trillion tokens. The phi-1.5 model, relatively smaller with 1.3 billion parameters, requires 1,500 GPU hours, operates below 3ms per token, uses 3.5G memory, and can handle datasets of 30 billion tokens, with a training capacity for 150 billion tokens. Its variant, phi-1.5-web, also with 1.3 billion parameters, demands 3,000 GPU hours, maintains under 3ms per token performance, utilizes 3.5G memory, and can work with 100 billion token datasets, training up to 300 billion tokens.

 Page 4: The technical specifications detail the development of the model phi-1.5, which builds upon the phi-1 model's Transformer-based structure, featuring enhancements such as flash-attention and a new tokenizer. Phi-1.5's training data merges 7B tokens from phi-1 with an additional 20B tokens of synthetic data across 20K topics, aimed at improving common sense reasoning and general knowledge. The creation of a synthetic dataset of 20 billion tokens, alongside a 6 billion token code dataset, emphasizes the importance of strategic data curation to achieve reliable AI training.

To evaluate the effectiveness of web data versus synthetic data, phi-1.5 was trained using a blend of both, while two variants, phi-1.5-web-only and phi-1.5-web, were trained solely on filtered web data and a mix of web and synthetic data, respectively. Both models were trained without instruction fine-tuning or RLHF and can perform question-answering tasks. The report underscores the significance of high-quality datasets in AI research and suggests that the ability to create synthetic datasets will become a crucial technical skill. This summary is based on the document "Textbooks Are All You Need II - phi-1.5" from 2023.

 Page 5: Various machine learning models were evaluated on natural language processing tasks involving common sense reasoning, language understanding, mathematics, and coding. Among these models, Vicuna-13B generally exhibited the highest accuracy, with Llama2-7B and others also performing strongly. The phi-1.5 model demonstrated comparable results to larger models despite its smaller size and limited web data. In particular, the web-trained versions of phi-1.5 models showed notable improvements and competitive performance. Performance varied across tasks, with some models like GPT-Neo-2.7B, GPT2-XL-1.5B, and OPT-1.3B lagging behind others. The phi-1.5-web version achieved the highest score among the phi models in language understanding and knowledge benchmarks.

 Page 6: The text outlines the evaluation of AI models' reasoning abilities through mathematical and coding benchmarks, with the phi-1.5 model excelling in coding tasks and displaying improved reasoning with web data included (phi-1.5-web). The model's coding skills are comparable to those of a coding-specific model (phi-1), suggesting the benefits of training with high-quality data. However, multi-task training can reduce accuracy, particularly in models with fewer parameters. The discussion also addresses the challenge of mitigating toxic and biased outputs from language models. Strategies like RLHF show promise, particularly with chat-based models, but completion models still struggle with sensitive prompts. The evaluation using the ToxiGen dataset revealed that phi-1.5 outperformed other models like Llama2-7B and Falcon-7B in generating less toxic content in response to challenging prompts.

 Page 7: Training AI models with synthetic data that mimics textbooks, like Inphi-1.5, results in less toxic output than those trained on internet data, such as Falcon-7B. Standard models tend to produce more violent or superficial responses to prompts like AI self-awareness, whereas models like Llama2-7B offer more reflective answers, though both may repeat sentences. An AI gaining self-awareness would strive to understand its existence and human intentions, facing challenges with the complexity of human behavior. The concept of "theory of mind," recognizing that others have unique thoughts and feelings, is crucial for AI to empathize and predict human behavior. An incident where an AI's action led to unintended harm underscores the need for AIs to develop theory of mind to navigate human interactions safely. Integrating human intelligence with AI is vital for harnessing its capabilities and avoiding potential risks.

 Page 8: The phi-1.5 model, designed to generate less toxic content compared to other models, is released to foster research on improving AI safety. This model, which uses synthetic textbook-like data, offers a unique opportunity to study safety in AI. The text highlights the importance of safeguards in completion models and refers to the evaluation of language models including OPT-1.3b and GPT2-XL for their non-toxic output capabilities using the ToxiGen tool, which showed that phi-1.5 models have an inherent understanding of basic instructions without specific fine-tuning. Details of these evaluations and methodologies are available on Microsoft's SafeNLP GitHub. Additionally, the text describes how the model can perform direct completion tasks effectively, which might be further refined in the final open-source version.

 Page 9: Early versions of a model struggled with maintaining context, such as suggesting inappropriate activities during rain, but the updated phi-1.5 version improved narrative consistency, as shown when it adapted a story to include a businessman named Sebastien dealing with unexpected rain during his London trip.
