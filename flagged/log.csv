This paper introduces phi-1.5, a 1.3 billion parameter language model with performance comparable to larger models and surpassing most non-frontier LLMs on more complex tasks. It is open-sourced to promote further research on important topics. The article compares the performance of phi-1.5 with other state-of-the-art language models on common sense reasoning, language skills, and multi-step reasoning. It shows that the model performs comparably in common sense reasoning and language skills and exceeds other models in multi-step reasoning.

  Page 2:  In the last few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI, but come with a cost. In this paper, the authors build phi-1.5, a 1.3 billion parameter model trained on a dataset of 30 billion tokens, and get common sense reasoning benchmark results comparable to much bigger models. They open-source their raw phi-1.5 model to the research community to facilitate research in in-context learning, mechanistic interpretability, and mitigating the risks of hallucinations, toxic content generation, and biased outputs. Phi-1.5 is the first language model at the one-billion-parameter scale to exhibit most of the relevant traits of larger language models.

  Page 3: 
This comparison of compute performance evaluates different models on a single A100-80G with context length 2048 and fp16. Llama-7B has 80K microbatch inference speed and 1T tokens data size. Phi-1.5 has 1.5K microbatch inference speed, 3.5G memory, 30B data size, and 150B train tokens. Phi-1.5-web has 3K microbatch inference speed, 3.5G memory, 100B data size, and 300B train tokens.

  Page 4:  This technical report outlines the architecture and training data used to train the phi-1.5 model, a Transformer with 24 layers, 32 heads, and 64-dimensional heads. The training data is a combination of 7B tokens from phi-1 and 20B tokens of newly created synthetic data, as well as 95B tokens of filtered web data, to teach common sense and general knowledge. It also highlights the importance of data in AI, and provides metadata for the source and page of the report.

  Page 5:  Phi-1.5-web-only achieved a large boost in performance compared to other models when trained on filtered web data, with no web data at all, Phi-1.5 was comparable to all the other models. The evaluation of standard language understanding tasks showed different results for each model, with Falcon-7B achieving the highest accuracy on PIQA, Hellaswag, OpenbookQA and SQUAD and MPT-7B achieving the highest accuracy on MMLU.

  Page 6:  This article discusses the ability of models to perform multi-step reasoning tasks when trained on a mix of natural language processing and coding tasks. It also evaluates the toxicity of generated content using a dataset of 86 prompts, with the phi-1.5 model scoring a 'pass' on 47 of them. The results show that phi-1.5 outperforms existing models, and that using high-quality, textbook-like data can store and access knowledge more efficiently.

  Page 7:  Inphi-1.5 is an example of synthetic data being used to train models which has a better effect on toxic content creation than models trained on web data. Theory of mind is proposed as a way to understand and predict human behavior, as AI lack this concept. An example is given of an AI which caused harm due to a lack of understanding of the human's intentions and motivations. AI is limited in its power and usefulness without the ability to understand and predict human behavior, and so achieving self-awareness in AI requires the combination of human intelligence and understanding.

  Page 8:  This paper looks at the use of a completion model called phi-1.5 to generate natural language without finetuning. It suggests the use of synthetic, textbook-like data to further improve safeguards. The model is tested using a safety score system and can be used to complete partial sentences from a given source, such as a textbook.

  Page 9:  This example uses an unexpected prompt (“rain in July”) to test the model's ability to adapt. The story follows Sebastien, a successful businessman visiting London, and serves as a reminder to be prepared for any situation. An example of a chain-of-thought prompting illustrates the importance of preparation, where Alice ended up with 20 apples in total after receiving 7 from Bob, giving 5 to Cook, and 3x the amount of apples she had from Tim.

  Page 10:  This script creates a socket object and listens for incoming connections. When a client connects, it accepts the connection and prints the address. Theoretical computer scientists are researching deep learning for its potential to revolutionize industries, its success on tasks like image recognition and speech recognition, and its scalability and generalization challenges. To improve these algorithms, new mathematical models and algorithms are being developed.

  Page 11:  Alice asked Bob for help writing a Python application to go through all files in a directory that do not end with "".json"" and Bob provided an example of code using the os module and a for loop to print all such files. A review of the game ""Random Game"" found it to be poorly optimized and crashing the user's laptop multiple times, recommending the developers take more care.

  Page 12:  
 Bob and Alice discuss the analogy of a mind and a lighthouse, and how culture can influence our thoughts and emotions. They agree that we should be mindful of our thoughts and emotions and ensure they are aligned with our goals and values. Additionally, python coding and commands such as 'ping' can be used to measure latency of ports.

  Page 13:  This code snippet provides solutions to two prompts involving Python functions, multiprocessing library functions, and matplotlib library functions. It also establishes a connection to Redis, converts data to a pandas Dataframe, and plots the number of requests over time using matplotlib.pyplot. Lastly, it includes a debugging feature that can be enabled by setting the value to 'True'.

  Page 14:  This work challenges the notion that language model (LLM) capabilities are solely determined by scale by introducing a 1.3 billion parameter LLM that performs similarly to models with more parameters. Future research is proposed on LLMs, open-sourced to facilitate further research, which suggests that significant LLM capabilities can be achieved with fewer parameters. The source also discusses research and experiments related to Artificial General Intelligence.

It references several related works, such as OpenAI's GPT-4 Technical Report and the RefinedWeb Dataset for Falcon LLM, as well as research papers exploring the development and training of trillion parameter models in 2020. It also mentions a research paper titled ""Llama: Open and efficient foundation language models"" which was published in arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.13971 in 2023.

  Page 17:  In [ZHB+19], researchers explored the possibility of a machine finishing a sentence with their paper ""Hellaswag: Can a Machine Really Finish Your Sentence?"", which was presented at the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in 2019. The research discussed was related to language models and their risks, with a focus on Chain-of-thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language models, judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-bench and chatbot arena, and Hellaswag.
